# NameUpdater

Absolutly bare minimal example of how to acomplish this task with a Blazor Server app.

Set connection string in AppSettings.json

Update the implementation in /Components/Pages/Home.razor, and style to your liking

/Components/App.razor for your "head content" i.e a favicon

/wwwroot/app.css for your global styles if you need them
